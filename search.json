Ultimately, this will give policymakers leverage in reducing the toll\nof mass evictions on their communities\nResearch Assistant with Professor Amanda Luby\nSwarthmore, PA (June 2021 - December 2021)\nConducted research to better understand the accuracy of 165+ forensic fingerprint\nexaminers’ results on 300+ distinct latent prints\nNavigated through FBI published White Box and Black Box data sets to obtain\ninformation on imputation bias, the idea where examiners change their minutiae\nmarkings on the prints to support their own conclusions\nCreated interactive graphs\nto depict discrepancies in examiners’ minutiae markings between stages of examination\nApplied hierarchical models to predict examiners’ minutiae movements based on\ndifficulty and clarity of print\nFindings suggest that current forensic fingerprint examination techniques allow\nfor imputation bias during print examinations. Standardizing the process allows\ntransparency in the process and can minimize imputation bias\nWrote paper on findings; candidate for Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition\nin Fall 2021\nPaper, co-authored with Amanda Luby and Thomas Daillak, titled “A\nComparison of IRT-based Methods for Spatial Responses” currently in revision\nCollege Positions\nStatistics Mentor\nSwarthmore College Math/Stat Department (August 2022 - May 2023)\nActively reviewed materials and assignments with students in STAT 011\n(Statistical Methods I), STAT 021 (Statistical Methods II), STAT 051 (Probability),\nand MATH 043/044 (Differential Equations)\nAssisted professors in addressing questions from 70 students regarding challenging\nproblems during weekly lectures\nComputer Science Mentor\nSwarthmore College Computer Science Department (August 2020 - May 2023)\nQuickly identified problem spots in students’ programs and encourage appropriate\nsolutions\nRan weekly help sessions attended by 20-30 students enrolled in introductory\nPython and C++ courses\nTutor\nSwarthmore College (January 2022 - May 2023)\nTutored students taking STAT 011 (Statistical Methods I) and STAT 021 (Statistical\nMethods II)\nHelped individual students understand concepts such as inference, confidence\nintervals, etc.\nGrader\nSwarthmore College (Spring 2021, Fall 2022)\nGraded for STAT 011 (Statistical Methods I) and CPSC 088 (Security & Privacy)\nProactively provide feedback to professors regarding struggling students\nStudent Academic Mentor\nSwarthmore College (August 2020 - May 2022)\nProvided academic advice and support for all students of Swarthmore College\nduring both remote and in-person semesters\nPlanned weekly events for first-year students to aid their transition to college\nWorked closely with the program director and a cohort of other mentors to best\nsupport the student body\nEnglish Tutor\nCentury Bridge, Taiwan (November 2019 - April 2023)\nIndividually tutored students ranging from three years old to adults in English\nAdapted teaching styles unique to each student’s needs and abilities\nHelped individual students learn vocabulary and grammar, prepare for TOEFL and\nIELTS exams, and/or participate in discussion topics\nCommunity and Leadership\nQuestBridge Board: Community Engagement Chair\nSwarthmore College (August 2022 - May 2023)\nCollaborated with 11 other board members to manage a budget of over $1300 to\nhost career development, community building, and mentorship events for all\nfirst generation low-income students at Swarthmore College\nDrafted, edited, and proofread flyers, posters, and emails for accuracy,\ntypos and structure\nUsed Canva to create social content on Instagram\nthat amplified both QuestBridge and Swarthmore College’s mission\nGender Minorities in Math & Stat Board Member\nSwarthmore College (August 2021 - May 2022)\nCollaborated with 4 other board members in order to foster acceptance, build\ncommunity, and improve support for all students at Swarthmore College, particularly\ngender minority students in the Math/Stat Department\nManaged a budget of $1500 to support workshops, meetings, and discussions about\ndiversity; increased membership by 90% throughout the course of the year\nSkills\nLanguages\nEnglish (native)\nMandarin (native)\nSpanish (beginner)\nTechnical\nPython\nR and RStudio\nLaTeX\nC++\nC\nSQL\nWolfram Mathematica\n\n\n\n",
