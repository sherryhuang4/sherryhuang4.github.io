    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nIn Philadelphia, 25 addresses have accounted for 8.6 percent of all eviction\nfilings in the county from 2016 to 2020. Meanwhile, other buildings in the\nneighborhood file few evictions despite serving tenants with similar socioeconomic\nbackgrounds. The two current contending theories for these “top evictor” buildings\nare: 1) abusive management or 2) buildings of last resort. Abusive management is\nthe idea that property managers may be too quick to file evictions. If, however,\n“top evictors” are serving as buildings of last resort, then the high eviction\nrates could be explained by the tenants that are selecting into these buildings.\nWhile the tenantry of top evictors may have similar socioeconomic characteristics\nas the tenantry of more stable buildings, tenant self-selection may be selecting\non observable characteristics associated with housing instability.\nThis research brief examines the mobility of renters in Philadelphia County in\nand out of these top evictor buildings since 2016. The analysis aims to understand\nwhy these buildings have such high eviction filing rates, as forced mobility is\ndisruptive and traumatizing for renters.\nData and Methods\nThis analysis makes use of the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data\nfrom 2015-2019 for the data sets on race, median household income, median gross\nrent, and college degree. The Eviction Lab collected data on the top 25 buildings\nand zip codes with the highest eviction filing rates in Philadelphia County, PA,\nas well as data on mobility to and from select addresses. An eviction filing refers\nto any non-commercial eviction (i.e., residential housing not occupied by a business)\ncase for which we observe a court record.\nUsing Philadelphia County census tract shapefiles\nfound on Open Data Philly, we clustered the census\ntracts by race, median household income, median gross rent, and college degree\nusing Latent Profile Analysis. Using a “VVV model” (varying volume, varying\nshape, and varying orientation) with six clusters, the model returned a lower BIC\nvalue (-7785.103) than other models and almost all other numbers of clusters.\nClustering allows us to group census tracts with similar races, incomes, rents,\nand college degrees. We then combined the clustered data with the top evictor\nbuildings (geocoded with QGIS) in order to discover if the buildings are clustered\nin a way that is different from low eviction buildings.\nTo analyze mobility flows across numerous buildings and zip codes, we incorporated\naddress data from Infutor. We identified the most recent moves before and after\nliving in a top evictor building and/or zip code from the Infutor data. We also\nfound buildings nearby with similar demographics but lower eviction rates using data.\nUsing the epiflows\npackage in R, we then created and compared network graphs for each property and\nzip code with the data. The buildings or zip codes serve as nodes, and edges\nrepresent a shared tenant. All plots can be accessed at this interactive data visualization app.\nResults\nAcross the top 25 top evictor buildings, we find that most of the top evictor\nbuildings are found in areas with lower median household income and lower percentage\nof White residents. We also find that almost all the zip codes containing top\nevictor buildings are found among the top 25 zip codes with the highest eviction\nfiling rates. Our analysis thus suggests that eviction filings are deeply linked\nwith race and poverty.\nMapping the network graphs of top evictors, “control” buildings, and zip codes\nallows us to compare general mobility patterns across the different areas.\nPreliminary research shows that the top evicting buildings’ network graphs do not\ndiffer significantly from their low-evicting neighbors. Our analysis suggests that\nbecause these network graphs do not differ, then these top evictor buildings are\nnot serving as buildings of last resort.\nWhile our analysis does not show that “abusive management” is the cause of the\nhigh eviction rates in these top evictor buildings, it is our best guess given\nthe patterns that we are seeing. Thus, the lab is following up by collaborating\nwith a team of legal aid providers, who will be doing interviews with tenants of\ntop evictor buildings to learn more about management practices there. Understanding\nwhat differentiates these top evictors from their seemingly similar neighbors\nwould give policymakers leverage in reducing the toll of mass evictions on their\ncommunities. If abusive management is in fact the case in these top evictors, then\ntop-down enforcement actions may be effective at reducing top evictors’ contribution\nto city-level eviction rates.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank the Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility\nfor fully funding this experience and allowing me to work with the Eviction Lab.\nI would also like to thank the Eviction Lab for allowing me to intern at their\nlab this past summer.

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nImputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. In\nthe forensic fingerprint examination process, this bias could come in during the\nstage of comparing two potential matching prints. Examiners are shown the latent\nand exemplar prints at the same time during this stage, and there is evidence of\nminutiae movement, addition, and/or deletion during this stage. In my Summer 2021\nresearch, I explored patterns in these movements in order to identify potential\nimputation bias in the forensic fingerprint examination process.\nMethods\nIn order to explore minutiae movement across variables such as examiners, prints,\nand feature types, I created an interactive visualization app\nas part of my Summer 2021 research with Professor Amanda Luby.\nThe app allows you to select pairs of prints via the Pair ID drop-down menu. Options\ninclude mates (variables starting with “M”) and non-mates (variables starting with\n“N”). The app also allows you to specify an examiner. On the right, the app displays\nthe minutiae markings of all the examiners who looked at the pair of prints (“Print”\ntab), or the minutiae markings of the specific examiner (“Examiner” tab), or the\nsummary of the analysis of the prints (“Summary” tab). In the Print and Examiner\ntabs, each point represents a minutiae marking by an examiner. Lines represent changes\nin their markings between stages of examination. Hexes represent the concentration\nof markings, where dark represents a higher concentration of markings in the area.\nThe Summary tab displays how many examiners looked at the pair of prints; which\npercentage of the examiners were correct, were inconclusive, changed minutiae markings;\nand the difficulty each examiner ranked the pair of prints.\nResults and Discussion\nAlthough moving minutiae can occur for a variety of reasons, imputation bias is\nstill prevalent when there are changes in minutiae. The concern with moving minutiae\nis that examiners could be doing so in order to confirm their preliminary conclusions.\nFor example, as shown by my app, examiners tend to move more minutiae in mated pairs,\nindicating that they may be changing more pre-marked minutiae from their first stage\nof examination in order to validate their individualization decisions. Additionally,\nexaminers who viewed the same latent print used in two different pairs have different\npreliminary markings, as well as different minutiae movements in the Comparison\nstage. This indicates that despite the use of the same latent print in both pairs,\nexaminers still mark different minutiae, and then choose to move them differently\nin the Comparison stage. The different minutiae movements indicates imputation bias,\nas they are choosing to move minutiae based on the exemplar print it is paired with.\nMany of the minutiae movement occur due to a lack of standardized procedure in the\nforensic fingerprint examination process. For example, more deletions might occur\nin the Comparison stage at an agency where there is a minimum minutiae requirement;\nexaminers might be unnecessarily marking minutiae in order to hit the minimum, and then\nlater deleting the ones that are not helpful. Imputation bias can lead to misidentifications,\nwhich can be very harmful in large, prominent criminal cases. Finally, as previous\npapers have mentioned, there should be a rigorously defined, standard forensic fingerprint\nexamination ACE-V process (Ulery et al., 2015). Many of the examiners, in the White\nBox study, stated that exclusions and inconclusive prints were more difficult when\nthey had to mark minutiae (which they were not required to do so in the Black Box\nstudy) (Ulery et al., 2015). This indicates that examiners do not necessarily have\nto mark minutiae in a standardized way. However, if they did, there might be more\ntransparency in the process, which is particularly important when errors occur.\nIn the studies, the consequences of making a false identification (or exclusion)\nare insignificant, but in true casework, the consequences could change many people’s\nlives for the worst.\nTerminology\nLatent print - An impression of the friction skin of the fingers or palms of the\nhands that has been transferred to another surface. These prints are typically lifted\nfrom crime scenes and are usually not of the highest quality.\nExemplar print - A print of the fingers and/or palms deliberately taken from an\nindividual for record-keeping purposes. Since these prints are collected under ideal\ncircumstances, they are usually high quality.\nMinutiae - Major features of a fingerprint image; they are used in the matching\nof fingerprints.\nMates - Two prints that came from the same source.\nNon-mates - Two prints that did not come from the same source.\nACE-V process - Method used to reach a determination on each print. ACE-V stands\nfor Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation, and Verification.\nAnalysis: The examiner assesses the exemplar print to determine if it\ncan be used for comparison. This step involves the preliminary assessment of\nseveral factors like the surface material, the substance of the print itself,\nand/or minutiae.\nComparison: The examiner is shown both the exemplar and a latent print.\nThe latent print may come from searching through the Automated Fingerprint Identification\nSystem (AFIS) or some other fingerprint database. The examiner analyses characteristic\nattributes of both prints and identifies conformities between the exemplar and\nthe latent prints.\nEvaluation: The examiner decides if the prints are from the same source\n(identification or individualization), different sources (exclusion), or are\ninconclusive.\nVerification: If an identification is made, the conclusion must be verified\nby another fingerprint examiner.\n\nReferences\nUlery, B.
